An explanation of how well your TinyFS implementation works:
We think it works relatively well. It uses a linked-list based implementation for handling i-nodes, extent blocks, and free nodes, and
while this implementation makes it relatively hard to adapt into a directory based file system without multiple superblocks, the efficiency
and organization of the data is well done.

An explanation of which additional functionality areas you have chosen and how 
you have shown that it works:
We chose to add renaming files/directory listing, as well as timestamping. In order to demo this, we simply showed that we were renaming files,
listing directory before and after deletion of a file, and doing read and writes to a file before listing the timestamps in order to show proper
time logging

Any limitations or bugs your file system has:
Mentioned in the demo video, but we are limited to 256 blocks because of how we chose to address blocks with one byte. While we have error messages
and handling, we also were unable to test it, due to certain errors being stress testing and more unreasonable edge cases (maxing out file blocks and
having data so large it overfills).
